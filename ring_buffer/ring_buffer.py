# A ring buffer is a non-growable buffer with a fixed size. 
# When the ring buffer is full and a new element is inserted, 
# the oldest element in the ring buffer is overwritten with the newest element. 
# This kind of data structure is very useful for use cases such as storing logs and history information, 
# where you typically want to store information up until it reaches a certain age, 
# after which you don't care about it anymore and don't mind seeing it overwritten by newer data.
